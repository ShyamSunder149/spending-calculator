# spending-calculator

This is basically one of my needs to do a finance manager and I don't want to make an entry daily on what I spend and do. And I find myself lazy to code an app which can scrape the messages which comes to the phone and shows you stuff. So instead I used google takeout to export my activities in google pay as html file and updated it as input to my program so I can check the spendings every month end. Please feel free to check out and let me know your suggestions. TIA

#### To-do :
- [ ] fix category expenses  
- [x] Pretty print output
- [x] Table display
- [ ] Export to csv option
- [ ] flags implementation
- [ ] Average per month spending calculation 
- [ ] Calculate big expenses separately
- [ ] Categorise big expenses 
- [ ] add separate implementation to add categories 
- [ ] Refactor the code
