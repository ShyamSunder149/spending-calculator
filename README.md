# spending-calculator

This is basically one of my needs to do a finance manager and I don't want to make an entry daily on what I spend and do. And I find myself lazy to code an app which can scrape the messages which comes to the phone and shows you stuff. So instead I used google takeout to export my activities in google pay as html file and updated it as input to my program so I can check the spendings every month end. Please feel free to check out and let me know your suggestions. TIA

#### To-do :
- [ ] fix category expenses  
- [ ] Pretty print output
- [ ] Refactor the code
